# Minty
Minty is a cool [pomodoro timer](http://en.wikipedia.org/ "relevant Wikipedia article") (pun intended) built with a focus on *speed*, *design* and *simplicity*.

## The name
'Minty' is a recursive acronym: "Minty Is Nonchalantly Timing You." I used 'nonchalantly' because 'nonchalant' is a synonym for 'cool.' And you know what else is cool? Mint.

## Branches
### gh-pages
Default branch. Everything should be properly tested before pushing changes.

### beta
Development branch. Probably incredibly unstable.
