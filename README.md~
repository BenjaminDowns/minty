# Minty: minty is nonchalantly timing you
Minty is a cool [pomodoro timer](http://en.wikipedia.org/ "relevant Wikipedia article") (pun intended) built with a focus on *speed*, *design* and *simplicity*.

## About
Minty is built using HTML5, CSS (+ Normalize and Skeleton) and JavaScript (+ jQuery) with help from Jekyll. I'm using Font Awesome for the icons.

## License
Minty is MIT licensed. For more information, look at the LICENSE file.

## Branches
### gh-pages
Default branch. Everything has to be fully and properly tested for stability before pushing changes.
(branch became stable on commit 67917cc; all prior commits are to be considered unstable)

### beta
Development branch. Probably incredibly, incredibly unstable.
